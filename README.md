# Blogging
Blog writing is a healthy habit which helps in sharing of thoughts, views and opinions among community. Many blogs provide commentary on a particular subject or topic, ranging from politics to sports. It may be used as personal online diaries, and as online brand advertising of a particular individual or company. A typical blog combines text, digital images, and links to other blogs, web pages, and other media related to its topic.

Our aim is to build a blogging site where people can write about themselves, share their stories, experiences and day to day thoughts etc.
Thus, it can help the community to form a deep sense of human connection. Moreover, it can promote sharing progressing ideas and solutions among people.
